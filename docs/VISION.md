# VISION

zypher exists to prove that **web frameworks do not need magic to be productive**.

Modern web development has drifted toward one of two extremes:
- Thin libraries that push all complexity onto the developer
- Heavy frameworks that hide too much behind runtime indirection and reflection

zypher deliberately rejects both.

Its vision is to be a **clear, explicit, batteries-included web framework** that:
- Teaches by being readable
- Protects developers through strong defaults
- Leverages compile-time guarantees instead of runtime tricks
- Makes the cost of every abstraction visible

zypher is built not just to ship applications, but to **help developers understand how frameworks like Django actually work — end to end**.

## What zypher Believes

- Frameworks should **reduce cognitive load**, not replace understanding
- Correctness should be enforced **as early as possible**
- Compile-time errors are a gift
- Web development can be productive *and* principled
- Learning-oriented software can still be production-grade

---

## What Success Looks Like

zypher is successful when:
- A developer can read the source and understand the full request lifecycle
- Common web mistakes are impossible or difficult to make
- The framework remains small enough to reason about
- Developers feel confident modifying or extending the framework

zypher does not aim to dominate the ecosystem.

It aims to **set an example**.
